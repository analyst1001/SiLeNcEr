This application automatically sets your android phone to silent mode whenever you are in particular locations. You can add the locations yourself.

For Developers:
This application is still incomplete. You can download it and develop it if u want. The "Remove" button does not works. I had some problems with determining GPS location on real android phone.
I thought of using requestProximityAlert() but I didn't wanted to use NETWORK_PROVIDER for getting location.
